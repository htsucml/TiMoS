# What is a trope?

A [trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope) is a storytelling device, or a shortcut, frequently used in creative productions such as novels, TV series and movies to describe situations that storytellers can reasonably assume the audience will recognize. Beyond actions, events, and activities, they are the tools that the art creators use toexpress ideas to the audience without needing to spell out all the details.
